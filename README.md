# datafun_06_eda
Performing and publishing a custom EDA project to demonstrate skills with Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and popular tools for data analytics. The notebook tells a data story and visually presents findings in a clear and engaging manner.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup for the Project

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. **Sign into GitHub.**
2. **Create a repository titled `datafun_06_eda` with a README.**
3. **Clone the repository to VS Code:**
	```powershell
	git clone https://github.com/ksteele3712/datafun_06_eda
	```
4. **Create a `.gitignore` file:**
	- Purpose: Excludes files and folders from being tracked by git (e.g., virtual environments, temporary files, system files).
5. **Create a `requirements.txt` file:**
	- Purpose: Lists all Python packages needed for your project so others can install them easily with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6. **Be sure to be in the right terminal directory before installing requirements:**
	- Change to your project folder:
	```powershell
	cd C:\Repos\datafun_06_eda
	```
	- Then use these commands to set up your Python environment:
	```powershell
	py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
	py -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
	```
    - Then use these commands to add in external requirements:
	```powershell
    pip install jupyterlab pandas pyarrow matplotlib seaborn
    ```
	- 
## üöÄ GitHub Commit Commands

Use these commands to commit and push your changes to GitHub:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "update changes"
git push
```


## 7. **Create and configure your Jupyter notebook:**
	- Create a file titled `kristinesteele_eda.ipynb`.
	- Click on 'Kernel' in the notebook and select your preferred Python interpreter.
	- Choose your `.venv` environment to ensure all dependencies are available for your analysis.
  

## üìÇ Importing Data Files

This project uses three main datasets:

- **Nutrition Values** (from Kaggle)
- **Fruit Prices 2022** (from data.gov)
- **Vegetable Prices 2022** (from data.gov)

To organize these files, we first created a `data` folder inside our `datafun_06_eda` project directory. We then downloaded the CSV files from their respective sources and placed them in the `data` folder:

- `data/nutrition_values.csv`
- `data/Fruit-Prices-2022.csv`
- `data/Vegetable-Prices-2022.csv`

This structure keeps our data organized and makes it easy to load each file in our analysis notebooks using pandas.

## ü•ó Chosen Dataset: Nutrition Values

For this project, I have chosen to work with the **Nutrition Values** dataset because nutrition is important to me. This dataset contains nutritional information for a variety of foods, including calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

**Dataset Description:**
The Nutrition Values dataset provides detailed nutritional data for many foods, which can be used to analyze dietary patterns, compare nutrients, and visualize nutrition trends.

**Local File:** [`data/nutrition_values.csv`](data/nutrition_values.csv)

**Source:** [Kaggle Nutrition Values Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

### üìä Inspecting and Summarizing Data

After importing the data files, we used pandas commands to inspect and summarize our datasets:

```python
print(df.head(10))      # Display the first 10 rows
print(df.shape)         # Show the shape (rows, columns)
print(df.dtypes)        # Show data types for each column
print(df.describe())    # Show summary statistics for each column
```

These commands helped us understand the structure and key statistics of our nutrition, fruit, and vegetable data before further analysis.
